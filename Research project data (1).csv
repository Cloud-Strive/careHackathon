SU;Coating of Material with Biosurfactant Compounds;The application of biosurfactant- to the surface of HDPE, PVC and stainless-steel grade 304 materials to reduce bacterial adhesion;Water, food, medical, other;"Biosurfactants produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa SB24 (rhamnolipid congeners), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens ST34 (surfactin and bacillomycin L analogues and homologues) and pigmented (P1) and non-pigmented (NP1) Serratia marcescens strains (serratamolide and glucosamine derivative homologues) were immobilised onto the surface of HDPE, PVC and stainless steel grade 304. To introduce functional groups (hydroxyl groups) to the surface of the materials, the materials were first treated with a Piranha solution and silanized with a 3-triethoxysilylpropan-1-amine (APTES) linker. The lipopeptides and glycolipid compounds were then chemically modified and covalently coupled to the APTES linker on the respective materials. 

Surface immobilisation of the biosurfactants onto the material surfaces was confirmed using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled to backscattered electron imaging-energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and water contact angle measurements. The coating and immobilization methods provide covalent linkages between the antimicrobial biosurfactant compounds and the APTES-functionalised material.

SU;Paper Sludge to Value Product Through Using a New Contaminant Sensitive Bioprocesses Technology;This reduces the number of contaminating organisms to acceptable levels and also aseptic transfer of the feedstock for the bioethanol market;;In an application of the process, the sterilisation system feeds an aliquot of paper sludge into the chamber of a decontamination vessel. Heat is provided to feedstock through direct contact between the reactor wall and direct steam injection. Sterilisation commences once the content of the decontamination unit reaches the desired temperature where it is maintained for about an hour. The unit is depressurised after sterilisation maintaining a positive pressure either by keeping an elevated temperature or by pressurising the unit with sterile air. The content of the decontamination unit is well mixed, during heating-up, sterilisation and depressurisation to ensure break-up of particles into a fine mix. The purpose of the mixing at elevate temperature is to evict trapped and sheltered organisms from the matrix of the feedstock. The mixture is loaded into a decontamination chamber. It is essential that the decontamination part of the process remain under elevated temperature to maintain sterility. A steam jacket surrounds the chambers and valves. After the sterilisation process the sterile product is pumped into the biofuel reactor vessel.;"Advantages

The high bioburden of paper sludge makes it very difficult to ferment. Unwanted paper sludge enters the fermenter via the paper sludge and becomes competition for the fermenting organism.

The process/system suggested utilized agitation, saturated steam and a sterile discharge to reduce the bioburden of paper sludge prior to entering the fermenter. Less or no organisms are therefore available to compete with the fermenting organism.

Reduce Bioburden

Apply internal mixing to disrupt the three-dimensional structure of the industrial by-product. Microorganisms become more vulnerable when exposed and thus more likely to be killed.

SU;Reversible Male Contraceptive;A novel, on-demand reversible hydrogel providing an effective and easily reversible male contraceptive solution;Healthcare;"Stellenbosch's solution is a 2-component hydrogel designed to block the vas deferens, thus preventing the passage of sperm cells. Unlike vasectomy, this hydrogel is easily reversible, restoring fertility. The hydrogel is formulated from two aqueous polymer solutions with complementary reactive groups that form a gel in 10-30 seconds upon mixing. This rapid gelation minimizes damage to the vas deferens. The hydrogel is stable and inert under physiological conditions, blocking sperm passage while allowing fluid diffusion. Reversibility is achieved by injecting a biocompatible compound that “uncrosslinks” and dissolves the hydrogel. This method is highly effective due to the low viscosity of the solution post-uncrosslinking, offering superior reversibility compared to other products like RISUG/Vasalgel.

Under practical conditions, the reversibility of the newly developed system is far superior to that of the currently available hydrogels.

Wits;PCL Knee Brace;Knee brace with a dynamic force mechanism forthe treatment and rehabilitation of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries;Healthcare;"Researchers at UCT in partnership with a knee specialist in private practice, have developed a novel PCL brace for the treatment of PCL injuries. The brace
was designed to provide a dynamic tension function of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) over the knee’s range of motion.
The designed brace uses a physical method of tensioning a cable while still using the calf cup technology. The tensioning method is that of a non-circular
pulley, also called a lobe, which changes the cable tension as a function of the knee’s flexion. This lobe on either side of the knee pull onto the cable causing a
reduction in effective length and pushing the calf cup forwards. The UCT PCL knee brace utilises a lobe design so as to increase the load that the brace applies
to the posterior side of the calf over the knee joints flexion range. The lobe was created with a surface that follows an involute profile, designed to force the
tibia forwards, alleviating pressure on the PCL. This method means that the PCL receives the forces required at its flexion levels current stress. There is
therefore no over-stressing of the joint at lower flexion ranges. This provides a stable long-lasting solution to the stress placed on the PCL.
The involute profile of the lobe can be developed to patient specific rehabilitation plans. The number of the lobes also means that multiple shapes can be
applied to get higher or lower medial and/or lateral forces applied to the posterior of the tibia, possibly allowing for rehabilitation of other ligament injuries.";"The novel UCT brace provides a technology which:
Provides a cost effective mechanism to introduce a dynamic force to assist and improve with PCL recovery
Could shorten the recovery times of PCL injuries and as a result reduce the treatment expenses
Allows for easy customisation of the patient specific forces required for optimal recovery through the novel tensioning/force mechanism ‑the
lobes/non‑circular pulleys. These lobes can easily be swapped in the braces throughout the recovery period if needed.

UP;Performance Optimizer for PV Panel Installations;Cost-effective means forrapidly monitoring performance of PV solar panels during operation.;Energy;The technology is a low-cost platform for capturing the impedance spectrum of a PV module or string within a very short period of time (compared to conventional impedance analyzers). The impedance spectrum is correlated with PV performance and a variety of online fault conditions can be characterized. The technology consists of measuring the electrical impedance response of an optimized and unique superimposed multisine broadband signal injected into the PV panel or string. The signal is capable of spanning a very large frequency range of between 100 Hz – 500 kHz with a very low crest factor, for characterizing various PV cells/modules. The superimposition of waveforms allows rich information of the cell condition to become more rapidly available when compared to conventional EIS. This is due to the fact that signals of different frequencies are injected simultaneously, making the impedance spectrum available much sooner. With the reduction in time required to obtain this information, the technology has the potential to serve as a useful online state-of-health tool for PV panels/strings. To date, broadband signals have not been applied to online PV modules/strings to determine their impedance and, as a result, the state of health of the PV panel/string. Impedance information provides more varied information based on the condition of the PV panel/string as opposed to voltage and current information.;The technology has the following benefits: Fast response and quick characterization for rapid assessment of the state of health of PV panels. Response time is typically in the region of 1 second, making it suitable for online implementation as it limits the risk of transients having an impact on the results. Characterization of impedance response allows richer diagnostic information of a PV panel vs. conventional voltage and current measurements. The impedance values are also captured over a much wider frequency spectrum to allow for a wider breadth of fault conditions to be monitored and detected. The detailed parameter information allows for better management of PV panels by having more detailed data on the changing state of the PV panels whilst in operation. Better information allows system owners to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary maintenance expenditure. Diagnostic parameters can be trended over time to establish a baseline and monitor the baseline behaviour and compare them to each other. This also allows for prediction models for specific site level installations.;Monitor the state of health, or obtain diagnostic information of PV panels in an online system environment. Primary function: To provide rapid online state of health monitoring and early warning system for PV systems to optimise system electrical energy output and reduce system losses and maintenance. A secondary function could be for the technology to surface rich system data to improve system prediction and management models. The technology can be integrated into power converter systems such as inverters or smart power modules or intelligent control systems to enable these systems to have more diagnostic functionality and extract better information from assets (PV panels).

Specific details of tests and their outcomes are available in the patent specifications ‑that can be reached via the links below. Use of the metal GDL also led to the development of a suitable gasket, which has also been patented;A microporous layer (MPL) is inserted between the catalyst layer and the metal GDL. This, along with the fact that the GDL is more rigid provides the following benefits: prevention of the accumulation of water at the interface of the catalyst layer and the GDL enhanced diffusion of the gasses to the catalyst layer lining of the pores of the GDL with the MPL material further reduce water accumulation and the formation of large water droplets. more uniform pressure distribution from the bipolar plate onto the catalyst layer and reduced contact resistances the metal GDL is thinner than conventional GDLs, which may reduce the height of the fuel cell stack A specific configuration of holes in the GDL is provided to maximise the exposure to the channel area of the bipolar plate and the repeating pattern leads to better gas diffusion and more uniform gas supply to the catalyst layer. A pin can be used as an alignment aid and it is located in the active area of the MEA to ensure that there is no impact on the gasket and sealing system.;This metal gas diffusion layer (GDL) can be used in hydrogen fuel cells to enhance the performance of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA).;7

UP;GREEN COAL – ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY COAL BRIQUETTES WITH LOW SULPHER EMISSIONS;"Transforming coal fine waste into valuable energy with lower emissions and
higher efficiency.";Energy, climate;"Green Coal is environmentally friendly coal briquettes
produced from discard fine coal, bio-char material, and
proprietary chemical binders. The briquette reduces sulphur
emissions during combustion by approximately 50%, while
also increasing the burning effectiveness.
The bio-char addition to the formulation is considered a
renewable energy source and therefore carbon credits can be
claimed for the reduction in the CO2 production. The use of
Green Coal provides an efficient system for greener coal
gasification, which is ideal for use in electricity generation and
other industrial steam raising applications";"Waste to energy
• Lower emissions
• Higher efficiency
• Mechanically robust
• Water resistant";"South Africa produces 255 million tonnes of coal annually, of
which 60 million tonnes are not usable due to its perceived
poor quality. These 60 million tonnes of discarded coal also
contain at least 15 million tonnes of fine coal. This coal is not
used and is therefore stored on mine sites. The coal still has
a lot of energy (higher heating value of 16 MJ/kg) associated
with it but cannot be used in the current equipment. Therefore,
by using the fine coal during the production of Green Coal, the
unusable discarded coal can be processed into a usable
product. This allows mines to increase their coal reserves
through the utilization of discarded coal.
The end product will primarily be offered to industrial coal
users using boilers. Another market potential exists in
electricity generation, providing an alternative to conventional
coal in the power stations. ";8

NWU;Separation, Purification and Recovery of Resveratrol from Wine Waste Using Aqueous Two-Phase Separation;The technology relates to a method for separating polyphenolic compounds from biomass, the products resulting from the method and their use;Nutrition, dietary supplements;"The technology described provides an efficient method for separating a polyphenolic compound (such as resveratrol) from biomass, the method comprising feeding the biomass into an aqueous two-phase system with a polymer phase and a salt phase and separating the polymer phase which includes the polyphenolic compound from the salt phase. The polymer used in the process may be a polyether and the salt may be selected from potassium sodium tartrate, sodium citrate, potassium phosphate, ammonium sulphate, and any combinations thereof. 

As illustrated by Figure 1 and Figure 1 biomass is milled prior to feed feeding it to the aqueous two-phase system so that it may be homogenised. The aqueous two-phase system has relative proportions of the polymer-salt solution selected to enhance resveratrol separation from the biomass. The method then includes a step of recovering the polyphenolic compound at least partially from the polymer phase. This step may be performed by protein precipitation to yield a polyphenol-protein precipitate or by the addition of a second polymer phase into a second aqueous two-phase system. The second polymer phase may comprise a carbohydrate. The resveratrol-protein precipitate or resveratrol-polymer solution are then dried to yield a polyphenol containing powder. 

The method allows for recycling of the polymer phase and salt phase in the aqueous two-phase system separating the polyphenolic compound from the biomass. The resveratrol-protein precipitate obtained by protein precipitation and the resveratrol-polymer powder obtained from the second aqueous two-phase system may be used in medicaments and dietary and nutraceutical supplements amongst other applications.";"An efficient method to produce resveratrol or other polyphenolic compounds from biomass.

NWU;Non-Reactive Solvent Assisted Fractional Crystallisation for the Separation of Cannabinoids from Wax;A method of extracting cannabinoids from a waste wax formed during conventional extraction of cannabinoids from Cannabis plants;Cannabinoid processing, Medical cannabinoid;"A method has been developed by which cannabinoids are extracted from a waste wax that is formed during conventional extraction of cannabinoids from Cannabis plants. During medicinal cannabinoid extraction process, cannabinoids are extracted from the plant material into an alcohol phase, which can be regarded as a cold extraction process (i.e., no application of heat). However, cannabinoids are not extracted in pure form since several flavour compounds and waxes are co-extracted. To remove the waxes, the extraction solution is frozen at -40 °C to precipitate the wax in a step called winterisation. This step allows solidification of the waxes, which are then simply filtered out of the solution and removed from the processing stream. Currently, the cannabinoid industry is seeking alternative applications for these wax waste streams. However, because the waxes still entrap significant amounts of cannabinoids, most extraction companies stockpile the waxes with a view of adding value once an effective extraction has been developed to extract the residual cannabinoids. Stellenbosch's solution manages to achieve this extraction and the method can unlock significant value within the cannabinoid industry for commercial extraction/purification facilities.

The extraction is obtained from a non‑reactive solvent assisted fractional crystallisation separating the cannabinoids from wax. The selection of the unique solvent along with optimised processing steps and conditions obtain a greater yield of high quality, medical‑grade cannabinoids.";"Greater yield of cannabinoids recovered from plants
