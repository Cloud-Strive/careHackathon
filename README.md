# careHackathon
Our teams hack for track 2 of the care hacktathon hosted by solvehub.

The idea was to use machine learning to create a matchmaking algorithm to connect users in a platform
The said users will be startups looking to get their ideas out in the world and investors looking to sponsor great opportunities.
